## Introduction
The music industry is a fickle beast. Everyone wants to have the next hit and be the next Taylor Swift, but how do we make a star? If we could predict what makes songs or albums popular, we could become the next big thing. This is one of many reasons I chose to explore music popularity for my project. 

Although I personally have no interest in becoming a pop star, I love listening to music and I've always been curious as to what makes some songs popular and others not. To dig into this, I found a dataset that contains information scraped from Spotify about individual songs and their popularity^[This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/music-albums-popularity-prediction?select=train.csv) on kaggle.]. I will use this data to create a model that predicts how popular music albums are on a scale of 1 to 100. 


## Data Overview
At minimum the response variable should be explored and analyzed in detail. Along with an inspection of the data for missingness and severe class imbalance of categorical data. The previous analyses should be conducted on the entire dataset.

Further exploration such as exploring relationships and transformations should be conducted on either a standalone dataset used only for an EDA or some portion of the training dataset from the initial split (can put it back into the training set when building models). Data from the final testing dataset (performance dataset) should not be used for this. This is a key step in feature engineering. A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis might be called for, especially if the data is completely new to you, but make sure it is not completed on the entire dataset! Such an EDA could be put in an appendix and only a short summary could be discussed in this section.

## Methods
Should cover the data splitting procedure and clearly identify what type of prediction problem it is. State and describe the model types you will be fitting. Describe any parameters that will be tuned. Describe what recipes will be used. Describe the resampling technique used. In some cases an extended discussion about recipe variations might be useful. Especially if students are using recipe variation to try and explore the predictive importance of certain variables. Explain the metric that will be used to compare and ultimately used to select a final model.

## Model Building & Selection Results
Should reiterate the metric that will be used to compare models and determine which will be the final/winning model. Include a table of the best performing model results. Review and analysis of tuning parameters should happen here. Should further tuning be explored? Or how should tuning be adjusted when fitting data like this in the future. This would be a good section to describe what the best parameters were for each model type. Could include a discussion comparing any systematic differences in performance between model types or recipes. If variations in recipes were used to explore predictive importance of certain variables, then it should be discussed here. The section will likely end with the selection of the final/winning model (provide your reasoning). Was it surprising or not surprising that this particular model won? Explain.

## Final Model Analysis
This is where you fit your final/winning model to the testing data. Assess the final model’s performance with at least the metric used to determine the winning model, but it is also advisable to use other performance metrics (especially ones that might be easier to communicate/understand). Should include an exploration of predictions vs the true values (graph) or a confusion matrix (table). Remember to consider the scale of your outcome variable at this time — did you transform the target variable? If a transformation was used, then you should consider conducting analyses on both the original and transformed scale of the target variable. Is the model any good? It might be the best of the models you tried, but does the effort of building a predictive model really pay off — is it that much better than a baseline/null model? Were there any features of the model you selected that make it the best (e.g. fits nonlinearity well)?

## Conclusion
State any conclusions or discoveries/insights. This is a great place for future work, new research questions, and next steps.

### Appendix: technical info — if needed
A place to share complex and important technical steps that may highly impact explorations, but the details are too technical to share in main body of the report.

### Appendix: EDA — if needed
A place to place a more thorough EDA, if needed. This should not include any data from the testing dataset!

### Appendix: extras — if needed
Add as many appendices as needed.
